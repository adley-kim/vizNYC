    "# Setting up Shapefiles\n",
    "\n",
    "[Shapefiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapefile) are a collection of file formats that are commonly used for working with geospatial data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Shapefiles can take the form of various *geometries*: points, lines, polylines, and polygons. We can use these geometries as containers onto which we can attach attributes and features the same way we would add columns to a table.\n",

    "### Coordinate Reference System (CRS)\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with geospatial data, we need to make sure that all of our data uses the same [coordinate reference system (crs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_reference_system). CRS varies from region to region, but the most commonly used one is [WGS-84](https://epsg.io/4326) (latitude/longitude).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Census Tracts\n",
    "\n",
    "Census tracts are the second smallest geographical unit used by the Census Bureau. Each tract has a 6-digit unique identifier that can be extended to include information specifying the county and state. In NYC, boroughs are coterminous with counties, meaning they have identical geographic boundaries. When working with NYC census data, census tracts are uniquely identified by a 6-digit code: the first digit represents the borough/county, followed by six digits for the tract.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** It's important that you use the 7-digit code (usually called `boro_ct2010` or something similar) and not the 6-digit `ct2010` code. Census tracts in different counties can have overlapping IDs!"
